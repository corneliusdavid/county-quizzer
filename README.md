## Overview ##

This program offers various types of "quizzes" to help the user learn the counties of the selected U.S. state. There are currently three types of quizzes:

1. List - simply type in all the county names, one per line; when finished hit the "Check" button to see how many you got right.
2. Multiple Choice - each county of the selected state is thrown in a list of 3 other counties; click the button showing the current state's county, see your score accumulate, and go to the next county.
3. Scrambled - each county name of the selected state is scrambled; type in the correct name and click "Check" to check your answer, then go to the next county.

There are more quiz modes planned, such as identifying a county by it's proximity to other counties, showing a map of it's outline in the state, and possibly others.

## Project ##

This is written in Delphi 13 as a mobile app for all platforms. As of October, 2025, it works Windows and Android. It uses a SQLite database where county information is stored.

## IN DEVELOPMENT! ##

This project, while working to a limited degree, is far from complete!  I have about 4 or 5 states in the database (and one test state) but would like to get all the states in the U.S. (or all the ones that actually have counties) added to the database. I also want to provide application options and be able to update county information.

## How this app came to be ##

I live in the beautiful U.S. state of Oregon and in 2025, a team led by Oregon State Senator, [Jeff Merkley](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/), put together their second [Oregon Treasures Quest](https://www.merkley.senate.gov/connect/oregon-treasures-quest/), a challenge to visit a highlighted spot in each of Oregon's 36 counties. I enjoy traveling and exploring and have a small RV so took on this challenge and learned more about the state in which I live. 

In addition to visiting each county and taking pictures, I wanted to be able to remember all the county names. Of course, being a techy I figured there had to be an app to help me with this; however, while there are many geography and mapping apps for countries and continents and major landmarks, I could not find one that focused on state counties. So, being the programmer that I am, I decided to write one! Thus was born **County Quizzer**!
